^#66ccff;Planetary Detector Node System^reset;

^#8aa0a8;Document ID:^reset; RX-ENG-X62S-0P7V
^#8aa0a8;Access Level:^reset; Level V Clearance Required
^#8aa0a8;Prepared By:^reset; Knightfall Asset Management Directorate",

"\n^#66ccff;ABSTRACT^reset;

As part of our efforts in containing the Ravenous Horde, the autonomous ^#66ccff;Planetary Detector Node (PDN)^reset; is a key component in Knightfall's defense strategy, serving as an early-warning and monitoring system to prevent critical planetary contamination. This documents the technical breakdown and operation of PDNs and the PDN network.",

"^#66ccff;TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS^reset;

^#66ccff;I. Deployment System^reset;

^#8aa0a8;Stage I:^reset; PDNs start out as rod-shaped pods enclosed in a protective shell. These pods are stored aboard starships, and are deployed by dropping them in low orbit over the designated planetary surface.

^#8aa0a8;Stage II:^reset; Once dropped, the protective shell shields the pod during atmospheric entry. This shell will gradually peel off as the pod",

"descends, ejecting completely once the pod reaches a certain altitude. Small parachutes may be deployed to slow down the descent, but not enough to compromise velocity.

^#8aa0a8;Stage III:^reset; Upon secure impact, the pod activates autonomously, deploying additional support arms that unfurl solar panels as the primary scanner comes online. The pod is now established as a node and will calibrate itself to better assess the planet's condition while connecting it to the galactic node network.",

"^#66ccff;II. Planetary Scanning System^reset;

^#8aa0a8;Scan Coverage:^reset; PDNs use a scanner system that monitors a planet's biological and atmospheric activity.

^#8aa0a8;Scan Cycle:^reset; PDNs will use a preliminary scan to establish a baseline. Afterwards, additional readings are performed every 8 hours. Weather and other environmental factors may affect this schedule. 

^#8aa0a8;Anomaly Detection:^reset; Extreme fluctuations or unnatural anomalies",

"that contradict initial conditions are communicated to the central monitoring network for analysis. Such inconsistencies may include but are not limited to:
- Unexplained fluctuations in gas emissions.
- Drastic, unscheduled changes in temperature.
- Decline in ecological activity.
- Repeated tectonic activity.

^#8aa0a8;Scan Range:^reset; PDNs have a scan radius of 3,000 km. Multiple nodes may be required to fully encompass a planet.",

"^#66ccff;III. Communication and Network Integration^reset;

^#8aa0a8;Data Transmission:^reset; Data collected by the PDN is transmitted via encrypted channels to the central monitoring network.

^#8aa0a8;Autonomous Data Processing:^reset; PDNs feature basic AI that filter out preliminary data before transmitting. Through reasoning and smart comparisons, the AI ensures that only suspicious information is sent to the network.",

"^#8aa0a8;Network Redundancy:^reset; Multiple PDNs are deployed around a single planetary body, ensuring complete coverage in the case of system failure or sabotage. 

This layer of redundancy also verifies the information of other PDNs; if multiple PDNs pick up the same anomaly, then that means that the data is consistent.",

"^#66ccff;IV. Power Systems^reset;

^#8aa0a8;Sustainability:^reset; PDNs are equipped with a plasma generator that activates on deployment, providing a stable power supply that will require refueling every 80 standard galactic months. Solar panels may be installed prior to drop off if the planet has abundant sunlight. PDNs can also connect to an existing electrical grid if deployed on a colony.

^#8aa0a8;Backup Systems:^reset; In the event of power failure, the PDN is equipped with",

"batteries that can provide power for 48 hours. An additional backup generator is also installed to provide short-term emergency power.",

"^#66ccff;V. Physical Specifications^reset;

^#8aa0a8;Height:^reset;
9.5 meters when unfurled, 8 meters when deployed

^#8aa0a8;Width:^reset;
2.5 meters in diameter when unfurled, 7 meters in diameter when deployed

^#8aa0a8;Weight:^reset; 1.5 tons

^#8aa0a8;Materials:^reset;
Constructed from durable and heat-resistant Elysian steel-carbide",

"composites. Protective shell is constructed with aluminum, titanium, and ceramic plates, laminated in a coat of electromagnetic resistant film.",

"^#66ccff;OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK^reset;

^#66ccff;I. Strategic Deployment^reset;
- PDNs are strategically deployed across federation territories, with a focus on regions deemed ^red;highly vulnerable to potential Ravenous incursions.^reset; Colonies, military installations, and resource-rich planets take utmost priority.

- Barren worlds and moons with no considerable mineral- or biomass are ignored as they pose no potential for an infestation.",

"^#66ccff;II. Maintenance and Monitoring^reset;
- PDNs operate continuously, providing round-the-clock surveillance for planetary ecosystems and relay updates to the central monitoring network.

- PDNs are designed for low-maintenance operation, requiring check-ups every 12 months or if the PDN has remained offline for a period of 72 hours. Emergency repairs are initiated via field repair teams or scouting teams.",

"^#66ccff;III. Incident Response^reset;

^#8aa0a8;Stage I - Assessment:^reset; In the event of a detected anomaly, the incident will be sent to the central monitoring network for assessment. Should the incident be deemed 'actionable' then the network will escalate to Stage II.

^#8aa0a8;Stage II - Investigation:^reset; Scouting teams near the detected anomaly will be dispatched to the affected region for further investigation. Any updates will be provided to the scouting teams during this stage.",

"^#8aa0a8;Stage III - Threat Response:^reset; If the scouting team reports the presence of a rogue Ravenous hive, then the incident will be escalated to Knightfall's High Command to assess the scale of the infestation and begin fleet deployment to neutralize the threat. The network may feed information as well to nearby outposts and defensive assets to assist in the operation.",

"^#66ccff;ADVANTAGES^reset;

^#8aa0a8;a. Efficient Early-Warning:^reset; PDNs offer an efficient early-warning system for detecting rogue Ravenous hives without the need for excess manpower or energy.

^#8aa0a8;b. Scalable Deployment:^reset; PDNs can be rapidly manufactured and deployed en masse, making it scalable, easy to maintain, and facilitating coverage even in the most remote corners of the federation.",

"^#8aa0a8;c. Environmental Adaptability:^reset; PDNs can function across a wide variety of hazardous environments, ensuring that the Horde cannot hide on hostile worlds.",

"^#66ccff;LIMITATIONS^reset;

^#8aa0a8;a. Potential Sabotage:^reset; Although durable, PDNs are still vulnerable to electrical interference and sabotage, as well as physical damage from hostile operators. High-risk regions will require constant maintenance and frequent replacements.

^#8aa0a8;b. Limited Scan Depth:^reset; PDNs can only detect surface-level and atmospheric disturbances. It cannot identify subterranean anomalies beyond aforementioned tectonic shifts.",

"\n^#66ccff;CONCLUSION^reset;

As galactic security remains Knightfall's strategic priority, the autonomous ^#66ccff;Planetary Detector Node System^reset; is an essential safeguard when monitoring and containing the threat of the ^#66ccff;Ravenous Horde.^reset; Its early-warning capabilities, scalability, and mass deployment ensures the preservation of many ecologically rich worlds from a catastrophic fate."
