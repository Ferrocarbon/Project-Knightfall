"CHAPTER I: Operations

^#66ccff;ENCAMPMENTS^reset;

Encampments are small military bases located on ^#a451c4;Alien^reset; worlds. These installations are common and typically temporary, a prelude to a proper stronghold or deconstructed once planetary operations have concluded.

They are denoted by the presence of gravel roads, smaller buildings, and light defensive emplacements.",

"CHAPTER I: Operations

^#66ccff;ENCAMPMENTS^reset;

Commanders operating encampments will offer missions of moderate difficulty, serving as an entry point for recruits or operatives looking to make a quick impact.

These missions will involve stealth, scouting, tactical battles, and disruptive operations.",

"CHAPTER I: Operations

^#66ccff;ENCAMPMENTS^reset;

Encampments will only offer basic facilities, but these should be enough for most recruits. Experienced operatives might want to look for Strongholds instead if seeking better accommodations.",

"CHAPTER I: Operations

^#66ccff;STRONGHOLDS^reset;

Strongholds are large military bases found on ^red;Volcanic^reset; worlds. These fortified locations are built to last, serving as a means to deter future invasions, interplanetary operations, or as a staging ground for the construction of a colony. Their most distinguishing features are the presence of tall towers, rigid construction, and heavy field fortifications.",

"CHAPTER I: Operations

^#66ccff;STRONGHOLDS^reset;

Field Marshalls operating strongholds will offer missions of higher difficulty, meant only for experienced operatives that hunger for fortune and glory.

Such missions will involve frontal assaults, flanking maneuvers, nest eradication, and defensive operations.",

"CHAPTER I: Operations

^#66ccff;STRONGHOLDS^reset;

Since strongholds are permanent emplacements, quality accommodations can be found here in addition to the basic ones found on Encampments. Expect facilities that can maintain and produce powerful pieces of equipment as well as exotic tech.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;WEAPON TYPES^reset;

Throughout your journey, you will encounter an arsenal of weapon types fielded by Knightfall and our enemies alike.

Understanding their functionality is crucial during combat.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;WEAPON TYPES^reset;

a. ^red;BALLISTIC / KINETIC^reset;
Armaments designed to kill targets by driving mass with lethal force. Ranged weapons utilize chemical or electromagnetic propellants, while melee weapons are self-explanatory.

Both are known to induce hemorrhaging while dealing higher alpha damage compared to Energy weapons.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;WEAPON TYPES^reset;

b. ^#66ccff;ENERGY^reset;
Weapon systems that are designed to destroy targets through the concentration of energy, either by focusing it through an apparatus, or electromagnetic manipulation.

Damage potential involves third-degree burns and collateral damage to the immediate surroundings.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;WEAPON TYPES^reset;

c. ^#f77800;EXPLOSIVE^reset;
Ordnance designed for eliminating large and durable targets, or anything within an area, usually propelled via rocketry.

Although effective at engaging multiple targets, payloads do not induce specific effects unless deliberately engineered to do so.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;RESISTANCES^reset;

The aforementioned weapons listed in the previous page may be used against you; Learn how to defend against them and how to counter enemies resistant to these weapons.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;RESISTANCES^reset;

a. ^red;ARMOR^reset;
A defensive covering made from composite metal sheets and ceramics. They can protect the wearer from ^red;Ballistic / Kinetic^reset; weapons but are vulnerable to damage from ^#66ccff;Energy^reset; weapons.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;RESISTANCES^reset;

b. ^#66ccff;SHIELDS^reset;
A protective barrier created from projected energy. They protect the wearer from ^#66ccff;Energy^reset; weapons but are vulnerable to ^red;Ballistic / Kinetic^reset; weapons.",

"CHAPTER II: Combat

^#66ccff;RESISTANCES^reset;

NOTES:

* ^#f77800;Explosive^reset; weapons are consistent against either shields or armor, but their ^#f77800;damage output is reduced^reset;.

* ^yellow;Prism^reset; weapons are the only energy weapons that can ^yellow;pierce through shields or armor^reset; and will do so at a constant, unmodifiable rate.",

"CHAPTER III: Factions

^red;THE SYN-AUG COMPACT^reset;

Information regarding the compact is limited, but we know that they're a criminal organization that has been parasitizing Knightfall's trade routes and industrial capability ever since the end of the first Knightfall-Ravenous war.",

"CHAPTER III: Factions

^red;THE SYN-AUG COMPACT^reset;

Our objective is to prevent them from disrupting our supply lines and planetary operations before they damage our effectiveness against the Horde.

They will be the primary opposing force on missions offered by ^#66ccff;Encampments^reset;, and you will find them scattered across the galaxy.",

"CHAPTER III: Factions

^#a451c4;THE RAVENOUS HORDE^reset;

A race of insects that are hell-bent on devouring all organic lifeforms. They are the reason the Knightfall Initiative was created, and they remain our primary antagonist.",

"CHAPTER III: Factions

^#a451c4;THE RAVENOUS HORDE^reset;

There are always two overarching objectives:

a. Seek out and destroy all rogue Horde fleets.
b. Drive off subsequent invasion forces.",

"CHAPTER III: Factions

^#a451c4;THE RAVENOUS HORDE^reset;

They will serve as the opposing force on missions offered by ^#66ccff;Strongholds^reset;, specifically objective A. You will work alongside our forces to drive off their presence.

Do not underestimate their strength, and expect utmost difficulty when engaging them.",

"CHAPTER IV: Closing Statement

As we conclude this field guide, we thank you for joining the initiative and affirming your commitment to defending the galactic order and the three tenets that forge the way forward.

The fight has only just begun. The outcome is uncertain. But we must be ready, no matter the cost. It is our promise to the Protectorate. And it continues to be our undying duty.",

"CHAPTER IV: Closing Statement

We stand united. And we fall fighting.

^#66ccff;To protect,
To preserve,
And to persevere.^reset;

Good luck out there, operative."
