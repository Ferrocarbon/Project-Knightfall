    "Throughout our history, the path that Knightfall walks on is one of blood and regret. We have always walked on a tight thread between sacrifice and principle; a curse that was bestowed upon us by those that came before.

Nevertheless, it is this path that gave birth to the core tenets. It not only embodies the mission that the Protectorate entrusted to us, but it allows us to conduct our duty while upholding the beliefs of our alma mater.",

"In solidarity, the Knightfall Initiative hereby pledges to every living soul in the Milky Way:

^#66ccff;To protect^reset; the galaxy from anything that threatens all life and galactic order. We shall lend our strength to those who stand boldly against tyranny, oppression, persecution, and annihilation.

^#66ccff;To preserve^reset; all life above all else. Our potential for destruction is profound, and it is for this reason that we must exercise restraint and discipline.",

"^#66ccff;To persevere^reset; for as long as we stand. Our duty is unceasing, and while battles await us, victory is uncertain. The end is never in sight.

Until then-

^#66ccff;We stand united. And we fall fighting.^reset;"
